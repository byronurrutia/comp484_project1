        <h1>Why Mechanical Keyboards</h1>
        <p>
          Most keyboards that come with laptops and desktops suck. Mechanical
          keyboards, so called because they have individual mechanical switches
          under each key, are more enjoyable to type on, more durable, and more
          customizable than those typical membrane, butterfly, or scissor-switch
          keyboards. And for people who spend all day typing, programming, or
          gaming, it can be satisfying to customize the size, switches, keycaps,
          layout, and even the backlight to your exact needs. If you&apos;re
          interested in mechanical keyboards but don&apos;t know where to start
          with all of the terminology and options, start here. And if you know
          the basics but want to go a little deeper, we&apos;ll point you in the
          right direction.

          The keyboard, a tool that each and every one of us interacts with
          daily. We probably spend as much time on a keyboard as we do on our
          phones and while we are constantly looking to own the next flagship
          device, few look to enhance their typing experiences. The keyboard is
          often overlooked, possibly never considered by most as something worth
          investing in, but mechanical keyboards aims to change that.

        <h1>Size and layout</h1>
        <p>
          The first and most important decision when shopping for a keyboard is
          what size and layout you want. You&apos;ll have about a gazillion
          options but they fall into four main categories: full-size,
          tenkeyless, compact, and ergonomic.
        </p>
        <img class="layoutPic" src="images/layout.jpg" alt="layout_img" />
        <p>
          <b>Full-size</b> keyboards have all of the keys, including letters,
          numbers, modifiers, function keys, arrow keys, and a number pad. We
          recommend this size only for people who prefer a built-in number pad.
          Wide keyboards force you to place your mouse farther from your body,
          which can put strain on your shoulders, neck, and back.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Tenkeyless</b> (often abbreviated TKL) keyboards lack a number pad
          but have all of the other keys. We recommend this size for most people
          because it&apos;s significantly more compact than full-size and has
          all of the most commonly used keys. And a standalone number pad is a
          better option if you want a numpad, because you can move it out of the
          way when you&apos;re not using it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <b>compact</b> category is a catchall for a variety of sizes and
          layouts. Boards that are 75%, like the Vortex Tab 75, have the same
          keys as tenkeyless, but they&apos;re all smushed together so that the
          keyboard has no empty space. Boards that are 65% and 68%, like the
          Qisan Magicforce and Drop Alt, lose the function keys along the top
          but keep the arrow keys and a few keys from the navigation cluster. We
          think 65% and 68% keyboards hit the sweet spot for most
          people—they&apos;re much smaller than tenkeyless boards, but they have
          all the most frequently used keys. Keyboards like the Vortex Tab 60
          and the Obins Anne Pro 2 include only the essential block of letters,
          numbers, and modifiers and have no function keys, no arrow or
          navigation keys, and no numpad. We recommend a 60% keyboard only if
          you&apos;re willing to retrain yourself to remember key combinations
          every time you need the arrow or function keys.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ergonomic keyboards can come in any of the above sizes but are split
          down the middle so you can hold your hands, wrists, arms, and
          shoulders at a more natural angle than you would on traditional flat
          keyboards. Ergonomic keyboards are either partially split and fully
          split. Partially split keyboards have a small gap down the middle but
          are connected at the bottom; they have a lower learning curve but
          &apos;t as adjustable as fully split keyboards. Fully split keyboards
          are the most flexible and adjustable, so you can angle each half
          however you prefer.
