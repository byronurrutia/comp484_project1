          Linear Switches: Smooth as Butter

          Linear switches are a type of switch that focus on producing a smooth,
          consistent actuation without any tactile feedback. Linear switches are
          great for people who don&apos;t like the small bump experienced from
          tactile switches or the loud noises from clicky switches. Linear
          switches are usually quiet, smooth, and consistent throughout the
          entire movement.They are especially used by gamers as the consistent
          keystrokes allow for more precision in highly competitive games.
          Linear switches are also enjoyed by people who prefer smooth movements
          while typing.

        <h1>Should You Get Linear Switches?</h1>
        <p>
          While linear switches are smooth and nice to use, there are some
          factors you need to consider before jumping aboard the linear switch
          train.For those of you migrating from a normal keyboard, the
          transition can be difficult as you may bottom out the switches at
          first. This can lead to some mild finger pain and discomfort. Once you
          get used to typing on the linear switches, they can be incredibly
          enjoyable and fun to use. Because of bottoming out issues though, we
          don&apos;t recommend linear switches if it&apos;s your first
          mechanical keyboard. Linear switches and more specifically, linear
          speed switches, are often used in the gaming community to give
          themselves a slight competitive edge over their opponents. If gaming
          is what you&apos;ll primarily use your mechanical keyboard for, it may
          be worth it to explore some of the speed switch options from Cherry MX
          and Kailh.
