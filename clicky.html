        <h1>Clicky Switches: Loud and Bumpy</h1>
        <img class="switch" src="images/Blue.gif" alt="blueswitch" />
        <p>
          Clicky switches are a type of switch that focus on producing a tactile
          bump and loud audible click with each keystroke. Loud and clicky
          switches offer great feedback when typing, so you know by the sound
          everything is working properly. Not to mention the sound is awesome.
        </p>
        <h1>Should You Get Clicky Switches?</h1>
        <p>
          While clicky switches are fun to use and offer the best feedback of
          any switch type, there are some factors you should consider before
          purchasing a keyboard with clicky switches. The main factor you need
          to consider is the sound. If you&apos;re working in a public space or
          even talking through a microphone the loud sound of the clicky
          switches can be irritating or distracting to those around you. While
          the clicky sounds may be enjoyable for you, keep in mind, it is a
          double-edged sword. If you&apos;re working from home and have a
          dedicated space without too close of a proximity to anyone else, feel
          free to get a clicky switch and start typing away, there is nothing
          stopping you.
