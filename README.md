#### DueTBD (Check on Canvas)

##### Purpose: In this project you are going to create the HTML and CSS for a website to match a consistent look and feel.

##### Requirements: Your project will consist of 5 main files: 4 HTML documents and 1 CSS document. The CSS file should contain the main style and formatting of the project.

###### You may use glitch or any editor that you prefer. For this project no use of libraries or automated CSS code-generation will be allowed. I want you to come up with the structure of your site andwrite the HTML and CSS that you feel fits that style. You may use lecture slides and the pasthw’s for sample code but make sure to make it your own. The purpose of this lab is to create a personal site about one of your interests. Examplesinclude but are not limited to: favorite movie, show, book, artist, band, genre, sport, team, person, place to visit, etc. Be as creative as you wish. If you have other ideas for your site we can further discuss online. Review lecture material and make proper use of the elements, properties, and roles covered.

###### What I will be grading on:

- Submission instructions followed (4 html and 1 css file included in your project)
- HTML and CSS has proper formatting and comments where appropriate
- Web page renders properly in Chrome
- Web page contains all required content, visually organized and styled according to spec
- CSS rules and HTML tags/attributes abide by specifications given in lectures
- Look up the MDN reference site for 3 elements and3 attributes not covered in class.Use them on your website. Add comments describing where they are, what they are, and how you are using them.
- Each student will list their 3 uniqueelements and 3 uniqueattributes on canvas. No
  duplicates on the list between students. First come first served
