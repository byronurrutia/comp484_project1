        <h1>Tactile Switches: Bumpy and Satisfying</h1>
        <img class="switch" src="images/Brown.gif" alt="brownswitch" />
        <p>
          Tactile switches are a type of switch that focus on producing a
          tactile bump and a relatively quiet audible click with each keystroke.
          Tactile switches offer great feedback when typing, so you know by the
          sound and feel everything is working properly and all of your
          keystrokes are getting logged. Not to mention they are satisfying and
          fun to use.
        </p>
        <h1>Should You Get Tactile Switches?</h1>
        <p>
          Tactile switches are fun to use and offer great feedback whilst
          typing, but there are some factors you should consider before
          purchasing a keyboard with tactile switches. Tactile switches are a
          great switch for beginners or anyone new to mechanical keyboards. They
          will be undoubtedly an upgrade from your normal laptop keyboard or
          membrane style keyboard. Anyone can pick up a keyboard with tactile
          switches and enjoy the satisfying bumps on each keystroke. Tactile
          switches produce a bump of varying sizes (depending on the switch) and
          emit a small clicky sound. The tactile switches are not quite as loud
          as a clicky switch, so you should be able to use them in a public
          setting without drawing too much attention to yourself with the noise.
          We highly recommend a tactile switch for someone getting a mechanical
          keyboard the first time.
